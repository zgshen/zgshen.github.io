To me, you will be unique in all the world. To you, I shall be unique in all the world ..." "I am beginning to understand," said the little prince. "There is a flower ...

And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure ... And your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky!
